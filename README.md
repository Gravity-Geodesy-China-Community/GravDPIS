# GravDPIS
The muti sources Gravity Data Processing and Interpretation System is a software toolkit written in C++ that enables the user to perform core gravity or geodetic tasks.

Key features
------------

gravity field recovery from satellite and terrestrial data

the determination of satellite orbits from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements

the processing of GNSS constellations and ground station networks.

Most tasks and algorithms are (optionally) parallelized through the Message Passing Interface (MPI), thus the software enables a smooth transition from single-CPU desktop computers to large distributed computing environments for resource intensive tasks.

For an easy and intuitive setup of complex workflows, GROOPS contains a graphical user interface where configuration files can be created and edited.

Installation
------------

GROOPS is written in C++ and contains some legacy Fortran code. To enable an intuitive interaction with the software, GROOPS includes a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is also written in C++ and depends on the Qt toolkit.

A detailed installation guide for Microsoft Windows and various Linux distributions can be found on the [Installation page](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

Getting Started
---------------

After a successful installation our [Documentation](https://groops-devs.github.io/groops/html/index.html) is the perfect way to get familiar with the different features of GROOPS.

GROOPS depends on data files such as Earth rotation, Love numbers, and wavelet coefficients. An initial data set that is regularly updated is available on [our FTP server](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/). You can choose between downloading the data directory or a single [zip file](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/data.zip) with the same content.

Releases and Contributing
-------------------------

If you encounter a bug, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/issues).

At the moment we do not plan to have a regular release cycle, rather we will release a new version when a new feature has become mature enough, or for critical bug fixes. GROOPS has functionality in place to handle interface changes, however we cannot guarantee backwards compatibility for all config files.

We appreciate all contributions including documentation and examples for the cookbook. If you want to add new functionality to GROOPS, please open an issue and discuss the feature with us.

Please see our [Contributing](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page to learn about how to best contribute to GROOPS.
